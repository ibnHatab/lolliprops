# Lolliprops

* ILL (Intuitionistic Linear Logic)
  no weakening and contraction rules

  | ⊕ , | additive disjunction, "either A, or B, but don’t know which", "someone else’s choice" |
  | &   | additive conjinction, "my own choice between both"                                    |
  | ℘ ; | multiplicative disjunction, "if not A, then B"                                        |
  | ⊗ * | multiplicative conjunction, "I have both"                                             |
  | !   | "of course", "generate any number of A’s"                                             |
  | ?   | "why not", "consume any number of A’s"                                                |
  | ⊥ ^ | negation                                                                              |


** Linear Implicationn: A ⊸ B
   indicates that the resource A is consumed and the resource B is produced
   A ⊸ B ≡ A⊥ ℘ B ("can B be derived using A exactly once?")
   : eating: hungry --o full

** Multiplicative Conjunction: A ⊗ B
   both resources A and B are present
   : euro (x) euro --o cake

** Additive Disjunction: A ⊕ B
   either resource A or B is present, but not both
   : lottery_ticket --o win (+) lose

** Additive Conjunction: A & B
   one can choose to have resource A or resource B, but the choice is
   exclusive
   : euro --o tee & coffe

** Bang: !A
   one can get an arbitrary number of copies of the resource
   : !(tee --o euro)

** Assotiation rules: ⊸, ⊕, &, ⊗, !
   !A ⊕ B ⊸ C should be read as ((!A) ⊕ B) ⊸ C



* Installation

  1. Add lolliprops to your list of dependencies in mix.exs:

        def deps do
          [{:lolliprops, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure lolliprops is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:lolliprops]]
        end
